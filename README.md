# MongoDB Community Repository

Welcome to the MongoDB community repo! This repo includes content for [MongoDB User Group (MUG)](https://www.meetup.com/pro/mongodb/) organizers. MUGs are intended for networking and collaboration for people who who share an interest in development and operations best practices with MongoDB.

## MUG Download Program

The MUG Download Program helps organizers around the globe and includes the following content:

- Presentations and notes: We release new content periodically in the [MUG Download](MUG Download) folder for you to share with your user group.
- [Digital survey](http://database.mongodb.com/community-survey): This survey creates a feedback loop between your members and MongoDB and helps us improve the content we provide.
- Best practices: We've gathered best practices from community leaders on organizing great MUGs into a [MUG guide](https://www.mongodb.org/community/playbook).
- Support from MongoDB: We can help coordinate MongoDB engineers, customers, and partners to speak at your MUG.

If you have any questions, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:community@mongodb.com).
