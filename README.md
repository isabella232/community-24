# MongoDB Community Repository

Welcome to the MongoDB community repo! This repo includes content for [MongoDB User Group (MUG)](https://www.meetup.com/pro/mongodb/) organizers. MUGs are intended for networking and collaboration for people who who share an interest in development and operations best practices with MongoDB.

## MUG Files

You can find current year decks in the ["Decks"](https://github.com/mongodb/community/tree/master/MUG%20Download/Decks) directory.  These are general purpose Presentations you can personalize for meetups or other events in which you'd like to share about MongoDB.
